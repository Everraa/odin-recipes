    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>New York Style Cheesecake has a rich, dense, smooth and creamy consistency that is hard to resist. When in the US it would be very difficult to walk by Cheesecake Factory without wanting to eat cheesecake. I would for no given excuse miss having my favorite cheesecake.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>360 grams Britannia Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Fresh cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Caster Sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 Whole Eggs , at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Digestive biscuit , crumbled into a coarse powder</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Butter (Salted) , softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin making the Classic New York Style Cheesecake Recipe, first we will make the crust for the cheesecake.</li>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl combine the biscuit crumbs and melted butter. Mix well to make a cheesecake crust mixture.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom of a springform pan. Refrigerate the pan along with the crumbs for about 15 minutes while you make the filling.</li>
        <li>Into the bowl of the stand mixer place the cream cheese, sugar, and flour, cream, eggs and vanilla extract. Whisk until well blended and smooth peaks form.</li>
        <li>Remove the crust from the refrigerator and spoon the cheesecake filling mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Place the cheesecake into preheated oven at 180 degree Celcius. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until almost set. </li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow it to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 14 to 15 hours to set well before serving. You can cover the cheesecake with a cling wrap or foil and freeze for a few weeks as well.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to serve the New York Style Baked Cheesecake, serve it along with a strawberry compote. </li>
    </ol>
